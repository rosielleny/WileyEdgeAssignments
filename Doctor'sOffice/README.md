# Doctors Office Appointments Management System - README

This README provides an overview of my exclusive contribution to the Doctors Office Appointments Management System project, specifically focusing on the Appointment entity. My work primarily involved creating endpoints, implementing appointment-related functionality, and integrating with the Patient and Doctor entities.

## Feature Overview - Appointment Management

In the Doctors Office Appointments Management System, my contribution centered around the Appointment entity, enhancing appointment scheduling, modification, and management. The key features and functionalities include:

1. **Appointment Scheduling:**
   - Implementation of endpoints and functions enabling users to schedule appointments with doctors.
   - Integration with the Patient and Doctor entities to ensure accurate assignment and tracking of appointments.

2. **Appointment Search and Update:**
   - Development of endpoints to search for appointments based on different criteria (e.g., patient, date, doctor).
   - Implementation of appointment updates, allowing modifications to appointment details such as patient, date, and doctor.

3. **Appointment Deletion:**
   - Creation of endpoints to facilitate the deletion of appointments, ensuring accurate removal from the system.

## Components Developed

1. **Appointment Controller:**
   - Design and implementation of the Appointment Controller to handle various appointment-related interactions.
   - Creation of endpoints for appointment scheduling, search, update, and deletion.

2. **Integration with Patient and Doctor Entities:**
   - Seamless integration with the Patient and Doctor services to accurately reflect patient and doctor information in appointments.
   - Collaboration with the Doctor and Patient teams for effective implementation.

3. **Appointment Validation:**
   - Incorporation of validation checks to ensure appointment validity, including doctor availability and time constraints.

## Key REST Endpoints

My contributions to the Doctors Office Appointments Management System resulted in the following REST endpoints related to appointment management:

1. **POST /appointments - Schedule an Appointment:**
   - Enables patients to schedule appointments with doctors, considering availability and constraints.
   - Ensures integration with patient and doctor entities for accurate assignment.

2. **GET /appointments - View Appointments:**
   - Retrieves a list of appointments based on different search criteria (e.g., patient, date, doctor).
   - Displays essential appointment information for review.

3. **PUT /appointments/{appointmentId} - Update Appointment:**
   - Facilitates modifications to existing appointment details, including patient, date, and doctor.
   - Ensures validation checks to prevent conflicting or invalid changes.

4. **DELETE /appointments/{appointmentId} - Cancel Appointment:**
   - Allows users to cancel appointments, ensuring accurate removal from the system.

## Note

It's important to mention that during the development process, the Patient functionality was not fully functional, resulting in the need to hardcode patient data for testing purposes. Additionally, the current version of the Appointments checks the appointment which is being booked against a doctors working hours and existing appointments, preventing a booking if the doctor is not available. If given more time, the application would display the doctor's availability during the booking process and only offer appointments in half hour slots.
